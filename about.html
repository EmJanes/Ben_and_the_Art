                <p class="page" id="contentstart">ABOUT US</p>
                <p><span class="aboutben">Ben:</span> PhD student studying neuroscience at Mizzou, works full time as a data analyst, intrested in all things handyman DIY related.</p>
                <p><span class="aboutemily">Emily:</span> Online student studying computer science through East Central College, passionate Airbnb host, furniture flipper, intrested in any hands-on crafting.</p>
                <p><span class="aboutus">Us:</span> A local coffeeshop open-mic-night is what started it all. Two years later bought our first house together and filled it with two dogs and a cat. Four years post coffeeshop we sold house one and moved into house two.</p>
                <h1>House One: From Safety Hazard To Home</h1>
                <p>The house was a 1930s "fixer upper", located right on the edge of downtown. In the process of viewing and inspecting, we saw areas needing fixed and lots of updating. After moving in we soon found that EVERYTHING down to subflooring would need replacing. Being full-time students and employees wasn't ideal for this kind of additional housework and meant any left over time went to remodeling which was almost entirely done by ourselves. Everything you'll find here we tought ourselves with the help of Youtube and Reddit tutorials. For the sake of safety, professionals were hired for a handful of projects (such as adding/moving gas lines).</p>
                <h2>House Two: Bigger - Newer - Sturdier</h2>
                <p>September 2021, we took advantage of the rise in the housing market, quickly finished any loose ends on projects, and sold House One.</p>
                <p>Now we have a 1960 (30 years newer than House One) five bedrooms, two and a half baths, finished basement with an unfinished portion connecting to the garage. It feels like mansion. Bonus: Our good friends are right next door neighbors! House two has already brought relief from the cramps of House One. Tight on space and one bathroom does no good for any size family.</p>
                <p>House One tought was great practice of the home buying process and to issues to inspect for. As mentioned earlier, House two is outdated (no updates since built in 1960) and has an ENTIRELY pink tiled bathroom and an ENTIRELY blue tiled (wall and floor tiling, both with color matched sinks). Also, hallway and living area had pink carpet... Pink carpet covering HARDWOOD flooring! Truely a mystery how that was ever a trend. Pink carpet was first to go, so check out <span class="navprojectpink"><a href="projects.html#pinkcarpet">House Two: Project Pink</a></span> for photos and insight on that adventure.</p>
